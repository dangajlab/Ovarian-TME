The file "code_deposit.r" include a short example to perform the immunoclassification on a dataset.
The datset is contained in the file "data.zip".  Such a file should be unzipped in the directory "data" (the txt files should be inside such a directory, not in data/data/).
To run the file the following libraries are needed:
dplyr
vroom
here
stringr
tidyr
RANN
purrr
future.apply

Some of them must be installed trough BiocManager.
